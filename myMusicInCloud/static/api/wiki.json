Manager Phil Harvey is often considered an unofficial fifth member.[5] The band renamed themselves &quot;Coldplay&quot; in 1998,[6] before recording and releasing three EPs; Safety in 1998, Brothers &amp; Sisters as a single in 1999 and The Blue Room in the same year. The latter was their first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.[7]"
