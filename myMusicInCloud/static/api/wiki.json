{'name':'coldplay','data':'<h3>Coldplay </h3><br>are a British alternative rock band formed in 1996 by lead vocalist Chris Martin and lead guitarist Jonny Buckland at University College London.[3] After they formed Pectoralz, Guy Berryman joined the group as a bassist and they changed their name to Starfish.[4] Will Champion joined as a drummer, backing vocalist, and multi-instrumentalist, completing the line-up. Manager Phil Harvey is often considered an unofficial fifth member.[5] The band renamed themselves Coldplay in 1998,[6] before recording and releasing three EPs; Safety in 1998, Brothers & Sisters as a single in 1999 and The Blue Room in the same year. The latter was their first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.[7]
They achieved worldwide fame with the release of the single Yellow in 2000, followed by their debut album released in the same year, Parachutes, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The band's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), was released to very favourable reviews and won multiple awards, including NME's Album of the Year, and has been widely considered the best of the Nelson-produced Coldplay albums. Their next release, X&Y, the best-selling album worldwide in 2005, was initially met with mixed to positive reviews upon its release. However, the band's fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), was produced by Brian Eno and released again to largely favourable reviews, earning several Grammy nominations and wins at the 51st Grammy Awards.[8] On 24 October 2011, they released their fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto, which was met with mixed-to-favourable reviews.'}
